# WebLc3
Platform for prototyping LC3 programs. This project implements a superset of the specification as defined by Yale N. Patt at the University of Texas at Austin and Sanjay J. Patel at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign in the second edition of their textbook.

## Virtual Machine Extensions
This machine is entirely binary-compatible with assembled LC3 programs. The following extensions have been applied to the virtual machine to give new meaning to previously-undefined instructions.
* JMP now supports label addressing, as JSR already does.
* NOT is implemented as XOR with the same semantics as ADD and ADD.
    * note that XOR is not directly supported in the assembler, but a macro simulates its use using .FILL directives.

## Assembler Extensions
This assembler is entirely compatible LC3 assembly programs. The following extensions have been applied to the assembler to give new meaning to previously-undefined syntax.
* JMP and JSR both support labels and registers; JSRR still only supports registers.
* Support for local labels has been added. Local labels start with a $ symbol and their visibility is limited to the nearest non-local label in either direction. These labels

The assembler also includes macro support. To bypass macros, prefix commands with the @ symbol (e.g. @add r0, r1, #5).
